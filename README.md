# Data-Wrangling-Analysis-WeRateDogs-Twitter-Account
In this report, I will be completing a data wrangling and analysis on the tweet archive of WeRateDogs (@dog_rates): 'WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog'.

WeRateDogs has an international audience with over 8.7 million followers. I will move through 2000+ tweets from the account with effective cleaning to facilitate a later insightful analysis. The data wrangling is the core of the report and includes 3 sections: Gathering Data, Assessing Data and Cleaning Data. The later Analysis section of the report will utilise visualisations to answer the questions I have posed the report.

1. How have ratings trended over time? 
2. What makes a highly rated Dog? 
3. Is there a relationship between ratings and audience interaction?

Finally, a well documented conclusion will form a summary of the main findings of the report.

I hope you enjoy the report!
