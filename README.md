# Data-Wrangling-Analysis-WeRateDogs-Twitter-Account
In this report, I will be completing a data wrangling and analysis on the tweet archive of WeRateDogs (@dog_rates): 'WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog'.

The data wrangling is the core of the report and includes 3 sections: Gathering Data, Assessing Data and Cleaning Data. The later Analysis section of the report will utilise visualisations to form various insights.

A well documented conclusion will form a summary of the main findings.

I hope you enjoy the report!



Utilises: Various packages in Python (pandas, numpy, requests, tweepy, json, timeit, matplotlib, seaborn)
